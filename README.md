This simple Next.js app shows you how to use ComputeSDK to create sandboxes with E2B and run a simple Vite app inside of the sandbox.
We used E2B for this example, but you can use any cloud provider (Daytona.io, Modal, Blaxel, CodeSandbox, Railway).
Go here for the [step-by-step instructions](https://www.computesdk.com/blog/how-to-run-your-first-e2b-sandbox/).

You will need to [register with ComputeSDK](https://console.computesdk.com/register) and generate an API key to create sandboxes.
You will also need an API key from E2B, Daytona, Blaxel, or some another one of our [supported providers](https://www.computesdk.com/docs/providers/more/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
